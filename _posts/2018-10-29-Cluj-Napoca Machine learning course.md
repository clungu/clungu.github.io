As I've said in my last talk at Cluj.AI (the one about [Building a recommender system](http://www.clungu.com/Building-a-recommender-system/) I'm putting together a local course about machine learning. 

Many people asked me details about this and if you're one of them and want to be updated please fill [this](https://goo.gl/forms/8NsQViFXmgVuWbyx2) form! The curricula isn't fully set so I'm hoping to gather feedback on what people expect and use it as a guide.  

This isn't a registration form, only a show of interest. I'll reply to everyone with the details that I have.
